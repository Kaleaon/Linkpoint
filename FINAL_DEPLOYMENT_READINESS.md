## 🚀 **DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS**

### **Step 1: APK Generation**
```bash
# Use Docker for x86_64 build environment
docker build -t lumiya-build -f /app/Dockerfile /app
docker run -v $(pwd):/app lumiya-build ./gradlew assembleDebug

# Expected result: app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk (17-20MB)
```

### **Step 2: Device Installation**
```bash
# Install via ADB
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk

# Or transfer to device and install manually through Android settings
```

### **Step 3: Initial Testing**
```bash
# Monitor logs during testing
adb logcat | grep -E "Lumiya|LoginActivity|SLAuth|OpenJPEG|ZeroDecode"

# Test sequence:
# 1. Launch app → Should show login screen
# 2. Enter credentials → Should validate and process
# 3. Tap login → Should show progress and attempt connection
# 4. Check response → Should handle success/failure appropriately
```
