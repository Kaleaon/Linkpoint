#### **2. Advanced Lighting System**
**Impact**: Realistic lighting and shadows missing
**Current**: Basic OpenGL ES lighting
**Need**: Deferred rendering, shadow mapping, ambient occlusion
**Complexity**: Very High (major rendering architecture change)

#### **3. Building Tools Enhancement**
**Impact**: Cannot create/modify complex content on mobile
**Current**: Basic object manipulation
**Need**: Advanced prim editing, linkset management, texture tools
**Complexity**: Medium (UI-heavy development)

### **🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY - Important for Advanced Users**

#### **4. LSL Script Editor**
**Impact**: Cannot edit/debug scripts on mobile
**Current**: Missing entirely
**Need**: Syntax highlighting, debugging, script management
**Complexity**: High (requires LSL parser, compiler interface)

#### **5. Mesh Upload System**
